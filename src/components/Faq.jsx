                  Book in advance: Booking your rental furniture ahead of time
                  can often result in lower prices. Compare prices from multiple
                  companies: Use websites like godrej, bajaj, or philips to
                  compare prices from multiple rental furniture companies. Look
                  for discount codes and coupons: Search for discount codes and
                  coupons that you can use to lower the rental price. Renting
                  from an off-airport location can sometimes result in lower
                  prices.
